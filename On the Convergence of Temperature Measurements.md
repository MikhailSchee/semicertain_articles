# On the Convergence of Temperature Measurements

06/16/2018

### Intro and motivation

> *The sun is mass of incandescent gas, a gigantic nuclear furnace*
>
> *Where hydrogen is built into helium at a temperature of millions of degrees*
> > from "Why Does the Sun Shine?" by They Might Be Giants

The above lyrics have a few elements that raise suspicion, the most obvious being the erroneous classification of the sun into the gas state of matter. However, that particular point is not the focus of this paper. Since the release of the song in question, They Might Be Giants have published a retraction both admitting to and correcting the error (see ``Why Does the Sun Really Shine?"). 
	
The element of interest for this paper is the absence of units on the ``temperature of millions of degrees." A likely argument the artist has for this omission is that the extra syllables needed to include the units would have made the line too much of a mouthful for the phrase of music in which it must be sung.  But perhaps a more subtle and borderline brilliant argument that could be read into the lyrics is, because the temperatures are so high in the sun, it does not matter which units are used.  

### Derivation
The three most common units for temperature are Kelvin, Celsius, and Fahrenheit [citation needed]. Therefore, only these three temperature units will be considered. Since Kelvin is an absolute temperature scale, the relative temperature measurements of Celsius and Fahrenheit will be compared to Kelvin. 

The temperature in Celsius ($C$) in terms of Kelvin ($K$) is given by

K = temperature in Kelvin
C = degrees Celsius
F = degrees Fahrenheit

C and F will be based off K because it is an absolute scale. 

C = K - 273.15
F = 9/5 * C + 32
F = 9/5 * (K - 273.15) + 32

Percent Error = (experimental - theoretical) / theoretical

K vs. C = (C - K) / K = (K - 273.15 - K) / K
K vs. C = -273.15 / K

K vs. F = (F - K) / K = (9/5 * (K - 273.15) + 32 - K) / K
K vs. F = (4/5*K - 459.67) / K
K vs. F = 0.8 - 459.67/K

How high does temperature need to go  until there is negligible difference between Kelvin, Celsius, and Fahrenheit?
"Sun is a mass of incandecent gas... at a temp of millions of degrees." Not actually gas, but does it matter what units of degrees are used?

K = temperature in Kelvin
C = degrees Celsius
F = degrees Fahrenheit

C and F will be based off K because it is an absolute scale. 

C = K - 273.15
F = 9/5 * C + 32
F = 9/5 * (K - 273.15) + 32

Percent Error = (experimental - theoretical) / theoretical

K vs. C = (C - K) / K = (K - 273.15 - K) / K
K vs. C = -273.15 / K

K vs. F = (F - K) / K = (9/5 * (K - 273.15) + 32 - K) / K
K vs. F = (4/5*K - 459.67) / K
K vs. F = 0.8 - 459.67/K

C vs. F = which do I divide by?
